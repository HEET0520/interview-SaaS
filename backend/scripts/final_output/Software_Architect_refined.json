        "answer": "System Design refers to the process of defining and designing the architecture, components, and interactions of a system to meet specific requirements and constraints. It involves identifying the functional and non-functional requirements of a system, such as scalability, performance, and security, and creating a blueprint for building and integrating the system's components. System Design is crucial in software development because it enables developers to create systems that are efficient, scalable, and maintainable, and that meet the needs of users and stakeholders.",

Availability: Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information.  Partition Tolerance: The system continues to function and make progress even when network partitions (communication breaks) occur.  In other words, a distributed system can at most guarantee two out of the three CAP properties simultaneously. This theorem has significant implications for the design of distributed systems, as it highlights the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.",

This can be achieved using RESTful APIs, gRPC, or message queues like RabbitMQ.  Asynchronous Communication: One microservice sends a message to another without waiting for a response. This can be achieved using message queues like RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or Amazon SQS.  Additionally, microservices can use Event-Driven Architecture, where one microservice publishes an event, and other microservices react to it. This approach enables loose coupling and scalability.

In contrast, microservices architecture is a modern approach where an application is broken down into a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other using APIs. Each microservice has its own codebase, and they are loosely coupled. The key differences between monolithic and microservices architecture are:   Scalability: Microservices allow for easier scaling of individual components, whereas monolithic architecture requires scaling the entire application.  Flexibility: Microservices enable the use of different programming languages, frameworks, and databases for each service, whereas monolithic architecture is limited to a single technology stack.  Resilience: Microservices allow for fault tolerance, as a failure in one service does not affect the entire application, whereas monolithic architecture is more prone to cascading failures.

They are optimized for structured data and support transactions, constraints, and joins.  NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. They do not use a fixed schema and instead use a variety of data models such as key-value, document, graph, or column-family stores. NoSQL databases are optimized for scalability, flexibility, and high performance.  The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:   Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema, while NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema.  Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model, while NoSQL databases use a variety of data models.  Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scaling, while SQL databases are designed for vertical scaling.

The core principles of RESTful APIs are:   Resource-based: Everything in REST is a resource, and each resource is identified by a unique identifier called a URI.  Client-server architecture: The client and server are separate, and the client makes requests to the server to access or modify resources.  Stateless: The server does not maintain any information about the client state between requests.  Cacheable: Responses from the server can be cached by the client to improve performance.  Uniform interface: A uniform interface is used to communicate between client and server, including HTTP methods, headers, and payload formats.  Layered system: The architecture is designed as a layered system, with each layer being responsible for a specific function, such as authentication or encryption.
