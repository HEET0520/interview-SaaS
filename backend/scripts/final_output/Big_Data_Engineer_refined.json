        "answer": "Hadoop can run in three modes:   Standalone Mode: This is the default mode of Hadoop. In this mode, Hadoop uses the local file system for input and output operations. It does not use HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and is mainly used for debugging and testing purposes.  Pseudo-Distributed Mode: In this mode, Hadoop runs on a single machine, but it simulates a distributed environment. It uses HDFS for input and output operations, but all the daemons (NameNode, DataNode, JobTracker, and TaskTracker) run on the same machine.  Fully Distributed Mode: This is the production mode of Hadoop. In this mode, Hadoop runs on a cluster of machines, and each daemon runs on a separate machine. This mode provides high scalability and fault tolerance.",

It represents a collection of data that can be split across multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing for parallel processing and fault tolerance. RDDs are immutable, meaning once created, they cannot be changed.

        "answer": "A functional interface is an interface that has only one abstract method. In Java, a functional interface can extend another functional interface. This is possible because a functional interface can have multiple default methods, static methods, and one abstract method. When a functional interface extends another functional interface, it inherits all the methods from the parent interface. This allows for more flexibility and reusability of code.",

Lists are built-in Python data structures that are dynamic, mutable, and can store elements of different data types. Arrays, on the other hand, are part of the `array` module and are more like arrays in other languages. They are homogeneous, meaning they can only store elements of the same data type.

This understanding will guide the chosen approach.  Some common techniques for handling missing values include:   Listwise deletion: Remove the rows with missing values, but this can lead to biased estimates and loss of data.  Pairwise deletion: Remove the missing values only for the specific analysis, but this can lead to inconsistent results.  Mean/median imputation: Replace missing values with the mean or median of the respective variable, but this can lead to loss of variability.  Regression imputation: Use regression models to predict the missing values based on other variables, but this can be computationally expensive.  Multiple imputation: Create multiple versions of the dataset with imputed values and combine the results, but this can be complex to implement.

        "answer": "Dimensionality reduction is a technique used in data analysis and machine learning to reduce the number of features or variables in a dataset while retaining most of the information. This is done to avoid the curse of dimensionality, which can lead to poor model performance, increased computational complexity, and difficulty in data visualization.  The benefits of dimensionality reduction include:   Improved model performance: By reducing the number of features, models can generalize better and avoid overfitting.  Reduced computational complexity: Fewer features require less computational resources and time.  Easier data visualization: Lower-dimensional data is easier to visualize and understand.  Noise reduction: Dimensionality reduction can help remove noisy or irrelevant features.  Feature extraction: Dimensionality reduction can help extract meaningful features from the data.  Some common dimensionality reduction techniques include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, and Autoencoders.",

        "answer": "Repartitioning and coalescing are two methods in Apache Spark to control the number of partitions in an RDD or DataFrame.  Repartitioning: Repartitioning involves reshuffling the data to create new partitions, which can lead to a full shuffle of the data. This is useful when you want to change the number of partitions or redistribute the data evenly across partitions.  Coalescing: Coalescing, on the other hand, involves combining existing partitions to reduce the number of partitions. This is useful when you want to reduce the number of partitions without reshuffling the data.  When to use each:   Use repartitioning when you need to change the number of partitions or redistribute the data evenly.  Use coalescing when you want to reduce the number of partitions without reshuffling the data.",

        "answer": "In Scala, the `Option` type is used to represent a value that may or may not be present. It's a way to explicitly handle the possibility of null values.  Using `Option` to remove null values provides several advantages:   Null safety: `Option` ensures that you explicitly handle the possibility of null values, reducing the risk of `NullPointerExceptions`.  Improved code readability: By using `Option`, you clearly indicate that a value may be absent, making your code more readable and maintainable.  Functional programming: `Option` is a fundamental concept in functional programming, allowing you to write more composable and predictable code.",

It is more flexible and efficient than `CHAR` for storing data of varying lengths.  For example, if we have a `CHAR(10)` column and insert the string `'hello'`, it will be stored as `'hello     '`.

LEFT JOIN returns all the rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the right side.  For example, if you have two tables, `orders` and `customers`, and you want to retrieve all orders with their corresponding customer information, you would use an INNER JOIN.

A subquery can be used in the WHERE clause to filter the results of the main query. The subquery is executed first, and the results are then used to filter the main query.  For example, if you want to retrieve all orders with an amount greater than the average order amount, you would use a subquery in the WHERE clause.  ```sql SELECT  FROM orders WHERE amount > (SELECT AVG(amount) FROM orders); ```  This query would return all orders with an amount greater than the average order amount.",
