DHCP allows devices to request IP addresses and other network settings from a DHCP server, which assigns the settings for a specific period of time.  The DHCP process works as follows:   DHCP Discovery: A device on the network sends a DHCP discovery message to find a DHCP server.  DHCP Offer: The DHCP server responds with a DHCP offer message that includes an available IP address and other network settings.  DHCP Request: The device sends a DHCP request message to the DHCP server to request the offered IP address and settings.  DHCP Acknowledgment: The DHCP server sends a DHCP acknowledgment message to confirm the assignment of the IP address and settings.  DHCP provides several benefits, including:   Easy network configuration: Devices can automatically obtain IP addresses and other network settings.

DNS Resolver: The DNS resolver sends the query to a DNS root server, which directs the query to a top-level domain (TLD) server.  TLD Server: The TLD server directs the query to a domain name server that is responsible for the domain.  Domain Name Server: The domain name server responds with the IP address associated with the domain name.

This is a security restriction to prevent malicious scripts from making unauthorized requests on behalf of the user.  CORS allows servers to specify which origins are allowed to make requests, enabling cross-origin requests while maintaining security. This is achieved through the use of HTTP headers, such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.  By default, web browsers block cross-origin requests, but CORS provides a way for servers to opt-out of this restriction, allowing legitimate cross-origin requests to be made.",

The main differences between REST and SOAP APIs are:   Architecture Style: REST is a resource-based architecture, whereas SOAP is an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) based architecture.  Request/Response: REST uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources, whereas SOAP uses XML to define the format of the data and relies on other protocols (like HTTP or SMTP) for message negotiation.  Statelessness: REST is stateless, meaning each request contains all the information necessary to complete the request, whereas SOAP is stateful, meaning the server maintains the state of the interaction.  Cacheability: REST APIs are cacheable, whereas SOAP APIs are not.  Scalability: REST APIs are more scalable than SOAP APIs due to their stateless nature.
