        "answer": "Linux and Windows are two popular operating systems with distinct differences. Here are some key differences:   Licensing: Linux is open-source and free, while Windows is proprietary and requires a license fee.  Security: Linux is generally considered more secure than Windows due to its open-source nature, which allows for community scrutiny and rapid patching of vulnerabilities.  File System: Linux uses a hierarchical file system, while Windows uses a drive-based file system.  Command Line: Linux has a powerful command-line interface, while Windows has a more limited command prompt.  Hardware Compatibility: Linux can run on older hardware, while Windows requires more modern hardware to function efficiently.  Software Availability: Windows has a larger market share, resulting in more software applications available exclusively for Windows. Linux, on the other hand, has a vast collection of open-source software available.  User Interface: Linux offers a variety of user interfaces, including GNOME, KDE, and XFCE, while Windows has a standardized user interface.  These differences contribute to distinct user experiences and use cases for each operating system.",

Hard links cannot span across different file systems.  Deleting a hard link does not affect the original file.  Soft Links (Symbolic Links):   A soft link is a reference to a file's path, rather than its inode.  Soft links can span across different file systems.

        "answer": "The end-to-end flow of authentication and authorization in a Spring Boot microservice using OAuth2 and JWT involves the following steps:   The client (e.g., web browser or mobile app) requests access to a protected resource.  The resource server redirects the client to the authorization server (e.g., OAuth2 server) to authenticate.  The client authenticates with the authorization server, and upon successful authentication, receives an authorization code.  The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token (JWT) with the authorization server.  The client includes the access token in the request to the resource server.  The resource server verifies the access token with the authorization server and authorizes the request if valid.  To secure downstream services, you can use the following approaches:   Use OAuth2 introspection to verify the access token with the authorization server.  Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to resources based on user roles.  Use JWT claims to convey user information and permissions to downstream services.",

Memory Manager: The Memory Manager is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory for Python objects. It uses a private heap to store all Python objects, and it's responsible for managing the memory for these objects.  Garbage Collector: The Garbage Collector is a cyclic garbage collector that periodically frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer needed. It does this by identifying objects that are no longer referenced and deallocating their memory.  Python's memory management is automatic, which means that developers don't need to explicitly allocate or deallocate memory for objects.

Both the original and the new reference point to the same object in memory.  If the object is immutable (e.g., a string or an integer), it appears as if it's passed by value, because you can't modify the original object.
