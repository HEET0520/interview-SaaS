        "answer": "Pattern matching in SQL allows you to search for specific patterns within string data. It is typically done using the `LIKE` operator, which can be combined with wildcards such as `%` (matches any number of characters), `_` (matches exactly one character), and `[]` (matches any single character within the brackets). Regular expressions can also be used in some SQL dialects for more complex patterns. Pattern matching is useful for filtering data based on partial string matches.",

For example:\n```sql\nSELECT  FROM customers ORDER BY name LIMIT 10;\n```\n\nThis will retrieve the first 10 rows sorted by the `name` column.",

It is used to establish relationships between tables and enforce referential integrity. The foreign key ensures that the values in the referencing column(s) match the values in the referenced primary key column(s).\n\nFor example, consider two tables:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE orders (\n    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    customer_id INT\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE customers (\n    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR(255)\n);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `customer_id` column in the `orders` table is a foreign key that references the `customer_id` primary key in the `customers` table.

        "answer": "A partitioned table in PostgreSQL is a table whose data is divided into smaller, more manageable pieces called partitions. Each partition can be stored in a different location and can have its own storage parameters. Partitioning is useful for improving query performance and reducing storage requirements.\n\nHere is an example of a partitioned table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE sales (     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,     region VARCHAR(50),     amount DECIMAL(10, 2),     sale_date DATE ) PARTITION BY RANGE (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date));\n\nCREATE TABLE sales_2023 PARTITION OF sales FOR VALUES FROM ('2023') TO ('2024'); CREATE TABLE sales_2024 PARTITION OF sales FOR VALUES FROM ('2024') TO ('2025'); ```\n\nIn this example, the `sales` table is partitioned by the year of the `sale_date`. Each partition (`sales_2023`, `sales_2024`) contains data for a specific year. Queries on the `sales` table can take advantage of partition elimination, where only the relevant partitions are scanned.",

Keep Transactions Short: Long-running transactions can hold locks for extended periods, blocking other sessions. Keep transactions as short as possible.\n2. Use Appropriate Isolation Levels: Choose the correct transaction isolation level for your application. Higher isolation levels can lead to more locking.\n3. Avoid SELECT FOR UPDATE Without a Need: Only use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` when you intend to update the rows immediately after. Otherwise, use a regular `SELECT`.\n4. Optimize Queries: Slow-running queries can hold locks longer. Optimize your queries to execute quickly.\n5. Use Indexes: Proper indexing can reduce the need for full-table scans, which can acquire fewer locks.\n6. Batch Operations: When performing bulk operations, use batch inserts or updates to minimize the number of locks acquired.\n7. Monitor Locks: Use PostgreSQL's built-in tools like `pg_locks` to monitor locking activity and identify bottlenecks.",
