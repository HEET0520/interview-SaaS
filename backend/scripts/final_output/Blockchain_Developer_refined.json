On the other hand, `map()` is used to transform an array by applying a function to each element, and returns a new array with the transformed elements.  You would choose `forEach` when you need to perform an action on each element, but don't need to transform the array. You would choose `map()` when you need to transform the array and return a new array with the transformed elements.

This ensures that data is protected from eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.  The main differences between HTTP and HTTPS are:   Encryption: HTTPS encrypts data in transit, while HTTP does not  Security: HTTPS provides a secure connection, while HTTP does not  Trust: HTTPS provides a trusted connection, while HTTP does not  For example, when a user enters sensitive information on an HTTP website, the data is sent in plain text and can be intercepted by an attacker.

This code is executed on the server and is used to handle requests, interact with databases, and generate dynamic content.  The main differences between client-side and server-side programming are:   Execution location: Client-side code runs on the client's machine, while server-side code runs on the server  Purpose: Client-side code is used for user interface and user interaction, while server-side code is used for data processing and storage  Language: Client-side code is typically written in JavaScript, while server-side code can be written in a variety of languages  For example, when a user submits a form, the client-side code validates the input and sends a request to the server.

        "answer": "CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented in web browsers to prevent web pages from making requests to a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) than the one the web page was loaded from.  CORS allows servers to specify which origins are allowed to make requests to their resources, and allows browsers to enforce this policy.  The main purpose of CORS is to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, where an attacker tricks a user into making unintended requests to a vulnerable server.  CORS works by adding headers to HTTP requests and responses, such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.  For example, if a web page from `http://example.com` makes a request to `http://api.example.net`, the browser will include an `Origin` header with the request, and the server can respond with an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to specify which origins are allowed to make requests.",

Transaction submission: The user's interaction triggers a transaction, which is submitted to the blockchain network. 4. Smart contract execution: The smart contract is executed, and the rules and logic defined in the contract are applied. 5. Blockchain validation: The transaction is validated by the blockchain network, and the state of the blockchain is updated. 6. Feedback loop: The user is provided with feedback on the outcome of their interaction, and the dApp continues to operate autonomously.  dApps can be used for a wide range of applications, including gaming, social media, and decentralized finance (DeFi).",
