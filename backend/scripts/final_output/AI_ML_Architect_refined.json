        "refined_question": "What are the different types of machine learning?",
        "answer": "Machine learning can be categorized into three primary types:   Supervised Learning: In this type, the model is trained on labeled data, where the correct output is already known. The goal is to learn a mapping between input data and the corresponding output labels, so the model can make predictions on new, unseen data.   Unsupervised Learning: In this type, the model is trained on unlabeled data, and the goal is to discover patterns, relationships, or structure within the data.   Reinforcement Learning: In this type, the model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the rewards and minimizes the penalties.  Each type of machine learning has its own strengths and weaknesses and is suited for different problem domains.",

        "answer": "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too complex and performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. This happens when the model is too specialized to the training data and fails to generalize well to other data.  To avoid overfitting:   Regularization techniques: Add a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large model weights.  Early stopping: Stop training when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade.  Data augmentation: Increase the size of the training set by applying transformations to the existing data.  Cross-validation: Evaluate the model on multiple subsets of the data and use the average performance as an estimate of its generalization ability.",

The allocation of data between the training, validation, and test sets depends on the problem and the available data. A common split is:   Training set: 60-80% of the data  Validation set: 15-20% of the data (used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection)  Test set: 5-10% of the data (used for final model evaluation)  The key is to ensure that the test set is representative of the data the model will encounter in real-world scenarios.",

Protected attributes (not exactly): Python doesn't have a built-in concept of protected attributes. However, by convention, attributes prefixed with a single underscore (`_`) are considered protected, meaning they should not be accessed directly from outside the class.  Private attributes (not exactly): Python doesn't have a built-in concept of private attributes.

        "answer": "Multithreading in Python is achieved using the `threading` module. This module provides a way to create multiple threads of execution that can run concurrently.  However, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), true parallel execution of threads is not possible in Python. Instead, threads are executed in a time-slicing manner, where each thread gets a slice of time to execute before the next thread is executed.  To achieve true parallelism, the `multiprocessing` module can be used, which creates multiple processes that can execute in parallel.",

They define how components interact with each other, which in turn affects the overall system's behavior. In a distributed system, consistency refers to the guarantee that all nodes agree on a single value, while synchronization ensures that nodes are updated in a coordinated manner.  There are several interaction models, including:   Synchronous: In this model, nodes wait for responses from other nodes before proceeding. This ensures consistency but can lead to performance bottlenecks.  Asynchronous: Nodes do not wait for responses, which improves performance but can compromise consistency.  Semisynchronous: A hybrid approach that balances consistency and performance.  The choice of interaction model significantly influences architectural decisions, such as:   Consensus protocols: Used to ensure consistency in distributed systems, e.g., Paxos, Raft.  Synchronization mechanisms: Used to coordinate node updates, e.g., locks, barriers.
