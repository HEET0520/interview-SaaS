In most cases, this language is 'not particularly severe' when it comes to throwing errors. In 'Strict mode,' however, all forms of errors, including silent errors, will be thrown.

Before starting the program, you must understand what kind of data you're working with.In contrast, Brendan Eich created JavaScript, a scripting language, at Netscape in 1995. It is a dynamically typed language, meaning that a variable's data type is determined at runtime. You do not have to declare the data type of a variable before using it.

They are mutable, meaning you can change their values once you create them. Unlike primitive data types, they're stored in memory as references rather than single values. Some examples of non-primitive data types include:Object (collection of key-value pairs, e.g., { name: 'cess', age: 26 };).Array (e.g., [10, 12, 13]).Function (e.g., function add(a = 10, b = 5) { return a + b; }).",

    "question": "4. If NodeJS is single-threaded, then how does it handle concurrency?",
    "answer": "NodeJS is single-threaded, but it can handle concurrency efficiently through its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. While the event loop in NodeJS runs on a single thread, it doesn’t block the execution of other tasks when waiting for I/O operations, such as file reads or database queries. Instead, NodeJS delegates these I/O tasks to the system's kernel, allowing it to continue processing other requests. Once the I/O operation is complete, the corresponding callback is added to a queue and processed by the event loop. This non-blocking approach enables NodeJS to handle multiple concurrent tasks without waiting for each one to finish sequentially.",
