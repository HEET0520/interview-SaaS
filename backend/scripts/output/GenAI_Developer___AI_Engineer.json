    "answer": "Please remember one thing, whether a language is compiled or interpreted or both is not defined in the language standard. In other words, it is not a properly of a programming language. Different Python distributions (or implementations) choose to do different things (compile or interpret or both).  However the most common implementations like CPython do both compile and interpret, but in different stages of its execution process.",

    "question": "Q1. What is the difference between tokenization and lemmatization?",
    "answer": "Tokenization is breaking down text into smaller components, typically words or phrases, called tokens. Lemmatization, on the other hand, involves reducing a word to its base or dictionary form (lemma). For instance, “running” becomes “run” through lemmatization, while tokenization would simply split the text into tokens.",

    "question": "Q3. How does a transformer model work, and why has it become the standard for NLP tasks?",
    "answer": "The transformer model uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the significance of different words in a sentence when encoding them. Unlike traditional recurrent models, transformers can process entire sentences simultaneously, leading to better understanding of context and relationships. Their parallel processing capability and efficiency in handling long-range dependencies have made them the go-to architecture for various NLP applications.",

    "answer": "DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its main goal is to shorten (and simplify) the software development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.It is important because it helps to improve collaboration between development and operations teams which in turn, translates into increasing deployment frequency, reducing failure rates of new releases, and speeding up recovery time.",

    "answer": "A container is a runtime instance of a container image (which is a lightweight, executable package that includes everything needed to run your code). It is the execution environment that runs the application or service defined by the container image.When a container is started, it becomes an isolated process on the host machine with its own filesystem, network interfaces, and other resources. Containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them more efficient and quicker to start than virtual machines.A virtual machine (VM), on the other hand, is an emulation of a physical computer. Each VM runs a full operating system and has virtualized hardware, which makes them more resource-intensive and slower to start compared to containers.",

These containers package an application along with all of its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files.That, in turn, ensures that the application can run consistently across various computing environments.Docker has become one of the most popularDevOps toolsbecause it provides a consistent and isolated environment for development, continuous testing, and deployment. This consistency helps to eliminate the common \"It works on my machine\" problem by ensuring that the application behaves the same way, regardless of where it is run—whether on a developer's local machine, a testing server, or in production.Additionally, Docker simplifies the management of complex applications by allowing developers to break them down into smaller, manageable microservices, each running in its own container.This approach not only supports but also enhances scalab",

    "answer": "Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later or multiple developers can work on the same codebase and eventually merge their work streams together with minimum effort.It is important in DevOps because it allows multiple team members to collaborate on code, tracks and manages changes efficiently, enables rollback to previous versions if issues arise, and supports automation in CI/CD pipelines, ensuring consistent and reliable software delivery (which is one of the key principles of DevOps).In terms of tooling, one of the best and most popular version control systems is Git. It provides what is known as a distributed version control system, giving every team member a piece of the code so they can branch it, work on it however they feel like it, and push it back to the rest of the team once they’re done.That said, there are other legacy teams using alternatives like CVS or SVN.",

    "answer": "A microservice is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services (hence the term “micro”).Each service focuses on a specific business domain and can communicate with others through well-defined APIs.In the end, your application is not (usually) composed of a single microservice (that would make it monolith), instead, its architecture consists of multiple microservices working together to serve the incoming requests.On the other hand, a monolithic application is a single (often massive) unit where all functions and services are interconnected and run as a single process.The biggest difference between monoliths and microservices is that changes to a monolithic application require the entire system to be rebuilt and redeployed, while microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for greater flexibility and resilience.",

    "question": "4. What are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)?",
    "answer": "GANsare machine learning frameworks designed by two networks: a generator that creates samples and a discriminator that evaluates them. The networks are trained concurrently to produce high-quality, synthetic (fake) outputs indistinguishable from real data.",
