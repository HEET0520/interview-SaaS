    "question": "1. What are Data Structures?",
    "answer": "A data structure is a mechanical or logical way that data is organized within a program. The organization of data is what determines how a program performs. There are many types of data structures, each with its own uses. When designing code, we need to pay particular attention to the way data is structured. If data isn't stored efficiently or correctly structured, then the overall performance of the code will be reduced.",

    "answer": "In Java, a constructor refers to a block of code that is used to initialize an object. It must have the same name as that of the class. Also, it has no return type and is automatically called when an object is created.If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler automatically provides a no-argument constructor, also called the default constructor.This default constructor calls the class parent’s no-argument constructor (as it contains only one statement i.e. super();), or the Object class constructor if the class has no other parent (as the Object class is a parent of all classes either directly or indirectly).",

You can checkthis OWASP guidefor more details.Use secure channels.Make sure the file upload is done through an HTTPS connection.Avoid name collision.Rename the file ensuring the new filename is unique within your system. Otherwise this can lead to application errors by not being able to save the uploaded files.Keep metadata about your files.Store it in your database or somewhere else, but make sure to keep track of it, so you can provide extra information to your users.

Focus on the business logic and don’t try to test the code that uses external services (like a database, the disk or anything outside of the piece of code you’re testing).Integration tests:Test the full endpoint through its public interface (the actual HTTP endpoint) and see how it integrates with the external services it’s using (i.e the database, another API, etc).Load testing / performance testing:You might want to also check how the new endpoint behaves under heavy stress. This might not be required depending on the API you’re using, but as a rule of thumb, it’s a good one to perform at the end of the development phase before releasing the new endpoint into prod.",

    "question": "How do you protect a server from SQL injection attacks?",
    "answer": "There are many ways to protect your relational database from SQL injection attacks, but here are three very common ones.Prepared statements with parameterized queries.This is probably the most effective way since it’s done by a library or framework, and all you have to do is write your queries leaving placeholders for where the data is meant to go, and then, in a separate place, provide the actual data.Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).These frameworks allow you to abstract the interaction with your database and create the SQL queries for you, taking into account all matters of security around that interaction.Escaping data.If you want to do this manually, you can take care of escaping special characters that might break how you construct your SQL queries. Keeping a list of blacklisted characters to escape in this situation is a good idea, so you can programmatically go through them.",

Usually, the CPU processes only one task at a time but the switching is so fast that it looks like the CPU is executing multiple processes at a time. They can support either preemptive multitasking, where the OS provides time to applications (virtually all modern OS), or cooperative multitasking, where the OS waits for the program to give back control (Windows 3.x, Mac OS 9, and earlier), leading to hangs and crashes.
