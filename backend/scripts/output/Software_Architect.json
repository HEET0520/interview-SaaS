In this protocol, the recipient's email address belongs to a different domain name or the same domain name as the sender (Gmail, Outlook, etc.). After that, the e-mail will be stored on the server, and later he will send it using thePOPorIMAPprotocol. Then, if the recipient has a different domain name address, theSMTPprotocol communicates with the DNS (Domain Name Server) for the different addresses that the recipient uses. Then the sender's SMTP  communicates with the receiver's SMTP, and the receiver's SMTP performs the communication. This way the email is delivered to the recipient's SMTP. If certain network traffic issues prevent both the sender's SMTP  and the recipient's SMTP from communicating with each other, outgoing emails will be queued at the recipient's SMTP and finally to be received by the recipient.

Focus on the business logic and don’t try to test the code that uses external services (like a database, the disk or anything outside of the piece of code you’re testing).Integration tests:Test the full endpoint through its public interface (the actual HTTP endpoint) and see how it integrates with the external services it’s using (i.e the database, another API, etc).Load testing / performance testing:You might want to also check how the new endpoint behaves under heavy stress.
