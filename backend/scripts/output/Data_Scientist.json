    "question": "What is the difference between correlation and causation?",
    "answer": "Correlation is the statistical measure that shows a relationship between two variables. When one changes, the other changes as well, positively or negatively. However, this doesn't mean that one variable causes the other to change. Causation means that one variable directly causes a change in the other. It implies a cause-and-effect relationship, not just an association. Proving causation requires deeper analysis and additional evidence.Example:There's a correlation between cart abandonment and uninstall rates in a shopping app. Users who abandon their carts often end up uninstalling the app shortly after. But that doesn't mean abandoning a cart causes someone to uninstall the app. The real cause might be a frustrating purchase process with too many steps. That complexity leads to both behaviors: abandoning the cart and uninstalling the app. So, while there's a correlation, you can't say it's causation without looking deeper.",

    "question": "What is the difference between univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis?",
    "answer": "Univariate analysis is all about looking at one variable on its own, with no comparisons, just understanding its distribution, central tendency, or spread. For example, I might look at the average test score in a class or the frequency of different grade ranges using histograms or summary statistics.Bivariate analysis looks at the relationship between two variables, such as how students' study time affects their test scores. To analyze this, I'd use tools like correlation, scatter plots, or line graphs to identify trends or patterns.Multivariate analysis, on the other hand, deals with three or more variables at once. It focuses on understanding how multiple factors combine to influence an outcome. For example, I might explore how sleep hours, study time, and caffeine intake together impact test scores. In that case, I'd use regression or a tree-based model to analyze the combined effect.",

    "question": "What is the difference between the long format data and wide format data?",
    "answer": "The difference between long format data and wide format data comes down to how your data is structured. A wide format has values that do not repeat in the columns, while a long format has values that do repeat in the columns.In wide format, you spread data across columns. Each variable (Jan, Feb, March) gets its own column. You'll usually see this in reports or dashboards.In long format, data is stacked in rows. One column stores the values, and another column tells you what those values represent. This format is cleaner for grouped summaries and time series analysis.Use case:Wide format is useful for reporting and making data visualizations. Long format is preferred for time series, grouped summaries, and plotting tools like Seaborn or ggplot.Common pitfall:Trying to perform group-level analysis on wide-format data without reshaping it first.",

    "question": "What is multicollinearity, and how do you detect it?",
    "answer": "Multicollinearity is when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, meaning they tell similar stories. This makes it hard for the model to figure out which variable is actually influencing the target, leading to unreliable or unstable coefficient estimates.For example, in a regression model looking at economic growth, common variables will be GDP, Unemployment Rate, and Consumer Spending. These variables are all related, and the model might not be as effective as it should be.To detect multicollinearity use:Correlation matrix:A correlation matrix detects multicollinearity by visualizing the strength of relationships between variables. A general rule is that any correlation value above 0.6 indicates strong multicollinearity.Variance inflation factor (VIF):VIF detects multicollinearity by giving a numerical value that indicates how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity. A VIF value greater than 5 indicates ",

    "answer": "Imbalanced data is a situation where the classes, labels, or categories in a dataset are not equally represented. In imbalanced datasets, one category has significantly more or fewer samples than the others. Imbalanced data refers to a common issue in supervised machine learning and deep learning where there is a non-uniform distribution of samples among different classes. This can lead to biased outcomes in models, such as those used in healthcare services, impacting their reliability and effectiveness.For example, if you build an email spam detection model and your dataset contains 5% spam emails and 95% non-spam emails, the data is imbalanced toward non-spam. This imbalance can negatively affect the model's performance, especially in production, because it may achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class while failing to detect spam effectively.",

    "answer": "The statistical significance of an experiment's insights can be assessed using hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing examines the probability of a given experiment's results occurring by chance. The null hypothesis is defined first, and then p-values are computed. If the null hypothesis is true, other values are determined as well. As its name suggests, the alpha value indicates the degree of significance.",

    "answer": "Data blending is a technique inTableauthat allows you to combine data from multiple data sources based on a common field or key. It enables you to analyze and visualize data that resides in different databases or files. Data blending is a more advanced way of combining two different data sources. For example, one data source shows the annual sales of a product in other countries, and another shows the profit and loss for each country each month. Different levels of segregation mean that a simple join won't work in this case. The first step will be to add up all the values in the second data source based on the year. After that, a join will be done. Tableau makes it very easy to do all of these steps because Tableau can find the field of country and year that is shared by two data sources and do a post-aggregate join on its own.",
