    "answer": "A stored procedure is a subroutine available to applications that access a relational database management system (RDBMS). Such procedures are stored in the database data dictionary. The sole disadvantage of stored procedure is that it can be executed nowhere except in the database and occupies more memory in the database server.

    "answer": "Answer –There is only one difference between configuring  AOAG in a single vs. multi subnet. You will follow same process that we follow  while configuring AOAG in a single subnet, but if you have a multi subnet network then  we need one IP from each subnet to configure the AOAG listener. Read attached article where  I have explained thestep by step process to configure AOAG in a multi subnet network.",
