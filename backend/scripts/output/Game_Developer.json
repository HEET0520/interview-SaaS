    "question": "2. How is Horizontal scaling different from Vertical scaling?",
    "answer": "Horizontal scalingrefers to the addition of more computing machines to the network that shares the processing and memory workload across a distributed network of devices. In simple words, more instances of servers are added to the existing pool and the traffic load is distributed across these devices in an efficient manner.",

    "question": "4. What do you understand byload balancer? Why is it important in system design?",
    "answer": "A load balancer works as a “traffic cop” sitting in front of your server and routing client requests across all servers. It simply distributes the set of requested operations (database write requests, cache queries) effectively across multiple servers and ensures that no single server bears too many requests that lead to degrading the overall performance of the application.",
