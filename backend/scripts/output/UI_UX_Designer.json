Otherwise this can lead to application errors by not being able to save the uploaded files.Keep metadata about your files.Store it in your database or somewhere else, but make sure to keep track of it, so you can provide extra information to your users.

Focus on the business logic and don’t try to test the code that uses external services (like a database, the disk or anything outside of the piece of code you’re testing).Integration tests:Test the full endpoint through its public interface (the actual HTTP endpoint) and see how it integrates with the external services it’s using (i.e the database, another API, etc).Load testing / performance testing:You might want to also check how the new endpoint behaves under heavy stress. This might not be required depending on the API you’re using, but as a rule of thumb, it’s a good one to perform at the end of the development phase before releasing the new endpoint into prod.",

Example: <img>.Block: Elements start on a new line, taking up the full width available by default. Their width and height can be set by you. Examples: <div>, <p>.",

    "answer": "Cookiesare small pieces of data stored in web browsers.

Data stored in sessionStorage is lost when the browser window is closed.Finally,localStorageis similar tosessionStoragebut persists even when the browser window or tab is closed and reopened. It provides long-term storage for web applications. They are very similar to cookies, however, the size limitations on localStorage are quite big compared to cookies, making it a much better alternative when storing large datasets.",
