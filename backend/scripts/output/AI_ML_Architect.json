    "answer": "When we remove the suffixes from a word so that the word is reduced to its base form, this process is called stemming. When the word is reduced to its base form, all the different variants of that word can be represented by the same form (e.g., “bird” and “birds” are both reduced to “bird”).",

    "question": "Q3. How does a transformer model work, and why has it become the standard for NLP tasks?",
    "answer": "The transformer model uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the significance of different words in a sentence when encoding them. Unlike traditional recurrent models, transformers can process entire sentences simultaneously, leading to better understanding of context and relationships. Their parallel processing capability and efficiency in handling long-range dependencies have made them the go-to architecture for various NLP applications.",
