    "question": "Why Is Git Used?",
    "answer": "Version Control: Git enables several developers to collaborate on a single project at the same time without hindering one another's contributions. It meticulously records every modification to the project's codebase, identifying the author and the timestamp of each change. This functionality is vital for synchronizing team activities and addressing any arising disputes.",
