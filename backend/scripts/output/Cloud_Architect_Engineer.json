    "question": "What Do AWS Solution Architects Do?",
    "answer": "AWS Solutions Architects are responsible for designing and managing applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. They work with developers and system administrators to ensure that applications are built to scale and perform optimally on the AWS platform. Solutions Architects also work with customers to help them understand how to best use the AWS platform to meet their business needs. In addition to their technical expertise, Solutions Architects must also be able to effectively communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.",

    "question": "1. What is Amazon EC2?",
    "answer": "EC2is short for Elastic Compute Cloud, and it provides scalable computing capacity. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware, leading to faster development and deployment of applications. You can useAmazon EC2to launch as many or as few virtual servers as needed, configure security and networking, and manage storage. It can scale up or down to handle changes in requirements, reducing the need to forecast traffic. EC2 provides virtual computing environments called âinstances.â",

    "answer": "A container is a runtime instance of a container image (which is a lightweight, executable package that includes everything needed to run your code). It is the execution environment that runs the application or service defined by the container image.When a container is started, it becomes an isolated process on the host machine with its own filesystem, network interfaces, and other resources. Containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them more efficient and quicker to start than virtual machines.A virtual machine (VM), on the other hand, is an emulation of a physical computer. Each VM runs a full operating system and has virtualized hardware, which makes them more resource-intensive and slower to start compared to containers.",

This consistency helps to eliminate the common \"It works on my machine\" problem by ensuring that the application behaves the same way, regardless of where it is run—whether on a developer's local machine, a testing server, or in production.Additionally, Docker simplifies the management of complex applications by allowing developers to break them down into smaller, manageable microservices, each running in its own container.This approach not only supports but also enhances scalab",

    "answer": "Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later or multiple developers can work on the same codebase and eventually merge their work streams together with minimum effort.It is important in DevOps because it allows multiple team members to collaborate on code, tracks and manages changes efficiently, enables rollback to previous versions if issues arise, and supports automation in CI/CD pipelines, ensuring consistent and reliable software delivery (which is one of the key principles of DevOps).In terms of tooling, one of the best and most popular version control systems is Git. It provides what is known as a distributed version control system, giving every team member a piece of the code so they can branch it, work on it however they feel like it, and push it back to the rest of the team once they’re done.That said, there are other legacy teams using alternatives like CVS or SVN.",

    "answer": "A microservice is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services (hence the term “micro”).Each service focuses on a specific business domain and can communicate with others through well-defined APIs.In the end, your application is not (usually) composed of a single microservice (that would make it monolith), instead, its architecture consists of multiple microservices working together to serve the incoming requests.On the other hand, a monolithic application is a single (often massive) unit where all functions and services are interconnected and run as a single process.The biggest difference between monoliths and microservices is that changes to a monolithic application require the entire system to be rebuilt and redeployed, while microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for greater flexibility and resilience.",

    "answer": "Kubernetes employsConfigMapsand Secrets to manage configuration. ConfigMaps store non-sensitive setup data, while Secrets handles sensitive information like passwords. These resources have different configurations from the application code, making updates easier. ConfigMaps have key-value pairs for different settings that can be accessed as environment variables or mounted files. Sensitive data is securely stored inSecrets, which are applied to the cluster using kubectl. Both ConfigMaps and Secrets are defined inYAML filesand applied to the cluster using kubectl. Kubernetes tracks changes in these resources, triggering updates in Pods without needing changes to the application code.",

After that, the e-mail will be stored on the server, and later he will send it using thePOPorIMAPprotocol. Then, if the recipient has a different domain name address, theSMTPprotocol communicates with the DNS (Domain Name Server) for the different addresses that the recipient uses. Then the sender's SMTP  communicates with the receiver's SMTP, and the receiver's SMTP performs the communication. This way the email is delivered to the recipient's SMTP. If certain network traffic issues prevent both the sender's SMTP  and the recipient's SMTP from communicating with each other, outgoing emails will be queued at the recipient's SMTP and finally to be received by the recipient.
