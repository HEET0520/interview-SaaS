    "question": "2. How to create empty tables with the same structure as another table?",
    "answer": "Creating empty tables with the same structure can be done smartly by fetching the records of one table into a new table using the INTO operator while fixing a WHERE clause to be false for all records. Hence, SQL prepares the new table with a duplicate structure to accept the fetched records but since no records get fetched due to the WHERE clause in action, nothing is inserted into the new table.",

    "answer": "A stored procedure that calls itself until a boundary condition is reached, is called a recursive stored procedure. This recursive function helps the programmers to deploy the same set of code several times as and when required. Some SQL programming languages limit the recursion depth to prevent an infinite loop of procedure calls from causing a stack overflow, which slows down the system and may lead to system crashes.",

    "question": "4. What is a Stored Procedure?",
    "answer": "A stored procedure is a subroutine available to applications that access a relational database management system (RDBMS). Such procedures are stored in the database data dictionary. The sole disadvantage of stored procedure is that it can be executed nowhere except in the database and occupies more memory in the database server. It also provides a sense of security and functionality as users who can't access the data directly can be granted access via stored procedures.",

It enables you to analyze and visualize data that resides in different databases or files. Data blending is a more advanced way of combining two different data sources. For example, one data source shows the annual sales of a product in other countries, and another shows the profit and loss for each country each month. Different levels of segregation mean that a simple join won't work in this case. The first step will be to add up all the values in the second data source based on the year. After that, a join will be done. Tableau makes it very easy to do all of these steps because Tableau can find the field of country and year that is shared by two data sources and do a post-aggregate join on its own.",

Earlier, storing SQL queries in text format directly in the dataset was generally not recommended. However, since shared datasets have been introduced, an SSRS can store a single data set and the data set can be shared by multiple reports. However, the ideal scenario would be to access a database server to use a stored procedure. The advantage is that in astored procedure, SQL will be available in a compiled format that offers all the benefits of using an SP as compared to using an ad-hoc query from the report. However, if you are using multi-select parameters you must understand that using a query rooted in a report or a shared dataset enables the report designer to take advantage of the multi-value parameter.Â",

However, this doesn't mean that one variable causes the other to change. Causation means that one variable directly causes a change in the other. It implies a cause-and-effect relationship, not just an association. Proving causation requires deeper analysis and additional evidence.Example:There's a correlation between cart abandonment and uninstall rates in a shopping app. Users who abandon their carts often end up uninstalling the app shortly after. But that doesn't mean abandoning a cart causes someone to uninstall the app. The real cause might be a frustrating purchase process with too many steps. That complexity leads to both behaviors: abandoning the cart and uninstalling the app. So, while there's a correlation, you can't say it's causation without looking deeper.",

For example, I might look at the average test score in a class or the frequency of different grade ranges using histograms or summary statistics.Bivariate analysis looks at the relationship between two variables, such as how students' study time affects their test scores. To analyze this, I'd use tools like correlation, scatter plots, or line graphs to identify trends or patterns.Multivariate analysis, on the other hand, deals with three or more variables at once. It focuses on understanding how multiple factors combine to influence an outcome. For example, I might explore how sleep hours, study time, and caffeine intake together impact test scores.

A wide format has values that do not repeat in the columns, while a long format has values that do repeat in the columns.In wide format, you spread data across columns. Each variable (Jan, Feb, March) gets its own column. You'll usually see this in reports or dashboards.In long format, data is stacked in rows. One column stores the values, and another column tells you what those values represent. This format is cleaner for grouped summaries and time series analysis.Use case:Wide format is useful for reporting and making data visualizations. Long format is preferred for time series, grouped summaries, and plotting tools like Seaborn or ggplot.Common pitfall:Trying to perform group-level analysis on wide-format data without reshaping it first.",

    "question": "What is multicollinearity, and how do you detect it?",
    "answer": "Multicollinearity is when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, meaning they tell similar stories. This makes it hard for the model to figure out which variable is actually influencing the target, leading to unreliable or unstable coefficient estimates.For example, in a regression model looking at economic growth, common variables will be GDP, Unemployment Rate, and Consumer Spending. These variables are all related, and the model might not be as effective as it should be.To detect multicollinearity use:Correlation matrix:A correlation matrix detects multicollinearity by visualizing the strength of relationships between variables. A general rule is that any correlation value above 0.6 indicates strong multicollinearity.Variance inflation factor (VIF):VIF detects multicollinearity by giving a numerical value that indicates how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity.

In imbalanced datasets, one category has significantly more or fewer samples than the others. Imbalanced data refers to a common issue in supervised machine learning and deep learning where there is a non-uniform distribution of samples among different classes. This can lead to biased outcomes in models, such as those used in healthcare services, impacting their reliability and effectiveness.For example, if you build an email spam detection model and your dataset contains 5% spam emails and 95% non-spam emails, the data is imbalanced toward non-spam. This imbalance can negatively affect the model's performance, especially in production, because it may achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class while failing to detect spam effectively.",

It all depends on the business context, of course.Impute or remove values: If you're going to impute data, use methods such as mean, median, or mode imputation, to calculate the missing values in a way that makes sense to the context of the data.
