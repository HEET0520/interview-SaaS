It is the execution environment that runs the application or service defined by the container image.When a container is started, it becomes an isolated process on the host machine with its own filesystem, network interfaces, and other resources. Containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them more efficient and quicker to start than virtual machines.A virtual machine (VM), on the other hand, is an emulation of a physical computer. Each VM runs a full operating system and has virtualized hardware, which makes them more resource-intensive and slower to start compared to containers.",

This consistency helps to eliminate the common \"It works on my machine\" problem by ensuring that the application behaves the same way, regardless of where it is run—whether on a developer's local machine, a testing server, or in production.Additionally, Docker simplifies the management of complex applications by allowing developers to break them down into smaller, manageable microservices, each running in its own container.This approach not only supports but also enhances scalab",

    "answer": "Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later or multiple developers can work on the same codebase and eventually merge their work streams together with minimum effort.It is important in DevOps because it allows multiple team members to collaborate on code, tracks and manages changes efficiently, enables rollback to previous versions if issues arise, and supports automation in CI/CD pipelines, ensuring consistent and reliable software delivery (which is one of the key principles of DevOps).In terms of tooling, one of the best and most popular version control systems is Git. It provides what is known as a distributed version control system, giving every team member a piece of the code so they can branch it, work on it however they feel like it, and push it back to the rest of the team once they’re done.That said, there are other legacy teams using alternatives like CVS or SVN.",

    "question": "What is a microservice, and how does it differ from a monolithic application?",
    "answer": "A microservice is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services (hence the term “micro”).Each service focuses on a specific business domain and can communicate with others through well-defined APIs.In the end, your application is not (usually) composed of a single microservice (that would make it monolith), instead, its architecture consists of multiple microservices working together to serve the incoming requests.On the other hand, a monolithic application is a single (often massive) unit where all functions and services are interconnected and run as a single process.The biggest difference between monoliths and microservices is that changes to a monolithic application require the entire system to be rebuilt and redeployed, while microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for greater flexibility and resilience.",

    "question": "What is a build pipeline?",
    "answer": "A build pipeline is an automated process that compiles, tests, and prepares code for deployment. It typically involves multiple stages, such as source code retrieval, code compilation, running unit tests, performing static code analysis, creating build artifacts, and deploying to one of the available environments.The build pipeline effectively removes humans from the deployment process as much as possible, clearly reducing the chance of human error. This, in turn, ensures consistency and reliability in software builds and speeds up the development and deployment process.",
