    "question": "4. What does containerization mean?",
    "answer": "As the term implies, containerization entails packaging together software code along with all the necessary components, such as frameworks, libraries, and other dependencies, in their own container. Among the advantages of containerization is that a container can be viewed as a fully packaged computing environment that can be transported in one piece.",

    "answer": "A container is a runtime instance of a container image (which is a lightweight, executable package that includes everything needed to run your code). It is the execution environment that runs the application or service defined by the container image.When a container is started, it becomes an isolated process on the host machine with its own filesystem, network interfaces, and other resources. Containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them more efficient and quicker to start than virtual machines.A virtual machine (VM), on the other hand, is an emulation of a physical computer. Each VM runs a full operating system and has virtualized hardware, which makes them more resource-intensive and slower to start compared to containers.",

This consistency helps to eliminate the common \"It works on my machine\" problem by ensuring that the application behaves the same way, regardless of where it is run—whether on a developer's local machine, a testing server, or in production.Additionally, Docker simplifies the management of complex applications by allowing developers to break them down into smaller, manageable microservices, each running in its own container.This approach not only supports but also enhances scalab",

    "answer": "Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later or multiple developers can work on the same codebase and eventually merge their work streams together with minimum effort.It is important in DevOps because it allows multiple team members to collaborate on code, tracks and manages changes efficiently, enables rollback to previous versions if issues arise, and supports automation in CI/CD pipelines, ensuring consistent and reliable software delivery (which is one of the key principles of DevOps).In terms of tooling, one of the best and most popular version control systems is Git. It provides what is known as a distributed version control system, giving every team member a piece of the code so they can branch it, work on it however they feel like it, and push it back to the rest of the team once they’re done.That said, there are other legacy teams using alternatives like CVS or SVN.",

    "answer": "A microservice is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services (hence the term “micro”).Each service focuses on a specific business domain and can communicate with others through well-defined APIs.In the end, your application is not (usually) composed of a single microservice (that would make it monolith), instead, its architecture consists of multiple microservices working together to serve the incoming requests.On the other hand, a monolithic application is a single (often massive) unit where all functions and services are interconnected and run as a single process.The biggest difference between monoliths and microservices is that changes to a monolithic application require the entire system to be rebuilt and redeployed, while microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for greater flexibility and resilience.",

Developers are responsible for coding part while the operations team is responsible for running the application and between these two there might be a gap. The operations team wants to run the application but they don't know how it works on the first place, and the developers would code without considering where or how the code will be deployed. While operations would try to deploy without really understanding what and why they are deploying or how the application even works. this would result in miscommunications between the two teams and causes not just less productivity and releasing the newer versions takes longer time, but also lesser quality applications being deployed without proper collaborati",

Tiller essentially listens and acts on the commands administered through the ‘Helm’ CLI tool and convert those to Kubernetes manifests. Helm packages are managed through an abstraction called ‘Charts’. There is an official chartrepositorymaintained by the Helm Community which hosts packages for the commonly used applications. Other than the already existing charts, users have the flexibility to create new charts for their unique use-case and push them to a public/private repository.",

    "question": "2. What are the key differences between traditional software development and machine learning development?",
    "answer": "Traditional software development involves writing deterministic code that produces consistent outputs for the same inputs, with a focus on logic and algorithms. In contrast, machine learning development relies on training models using data, which introduces variability. This means machine learning requires continuous monitoring, updating, and retraining to maintain model performance over time, especially as data distributions shift.",

  {
    "question": "5. What is data versioning, and why is it important in MLOps?",
    "answer": "Data versioning involves tracking changes to datasets, which is crucial for managing the lifecycle of machine learning models. As models are sensitive to the data they are trained on, maintaining versions of datasets allows teams to experiment with different configurations and revert to earlier versions if needed. This practice ensures consistency, reproducibility, and better management of data quality over time.",

  {
    "question": "7. What is the purpose of model training and validation?",
    "answer": "Model training involves teaching an algorithm to recognize patterns by adjusting its parameters based on input data. Validation assesses how well the trained model performs on a separate, unseen dataset. This step is crucial for ensuring that the model generalizes effectively to new data and does not overfit the training set, thus enhancing its predictive performance in real-world applications.",
