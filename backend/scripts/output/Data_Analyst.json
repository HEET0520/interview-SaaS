    "answer": "A stored procedure is a subroutine available to applications that access a relational database management system (RDBMS). Such procedures are stored in the database data dictionary. The sole disadvantage of stored procedure is that it can be executed nowhere except in the database and occupies more memory in the database server. It also provides a sense of security and functionality as users who can't access the data directly can be granted access via stored procedures.",

This data can come from databases, APIs, spreadsheets, or even third-party sources.Clean and organize the data: We'll want to clean the data by removing duplicates, handling absent values, and standardizing formats.Explore the data through visualizations: With the clean data, start playing around with different visualizations to explore trends, distributions, and relationships.Draw conclusions based on findings: Finally, analyze the data in the context of the original problem and use the results to draw insights.",

    "answer": "Cleaning data and handling the lack of some values typically involves several steps:Identify missing or inconsistent data: We first have to scan the dataset for null values, anomalies, or formatting issues that could be caused by errors.Assess the impact of missing values: We then evaluate how much data is missing and determine how critical those fields are to the analysis.Select a handling strategy: Next, we choose whether to fill in missing data (imputation), exclude affected rows, or flag incomplete records. It all depends on the business context, of course.Impute or remove values: If you're going to impute data, use methods such as mean, median, or mode imputation, to calculate the missing values in a way that makes sense to the context of the data. Otherwise, just remove records with excessive gaps if necessary.Verify the cleaned dataset: Run data validation checks to ensure that the cleaning process preserved data integrity and did not introduce bias.",

    "answer": "A tableau dashboard is a final step in creating the visualisation. First, make all of the charts in separate sheets. Then, click \"add new dashboard\" in the tab where you add new worksheets. You can also right-click on the \"Add new sheet\" button and choose \"Add new dashboard\" instead of \"sheet.\" To create a new dashboard differently, click Dashboard in the toolbar. Once you've done one of those three things, you'll be brought to a new dashboard where you can begin piecing together your story by dragging the relevant sheets from the left panel onto the dashboard individually.",

    "question": "6. What is data blending in Tableau?",
    "answer": "Data blending is a technique inTableauthat allows you to combine data from multiple data sources based on a common field or key. It enables you to analyze and visualize data that resides in different databases or files. Data blending is a more advanced way of combining two different data sources. For example, one data source shows the annual sales of a product in other countries, and another shows the profit and loss for each country each month. Different levels of segregation mean that a simple join won't work in this case. The first step will be to add up all the values in the second data source based on the year. After that, a join will be done. Tableau makes it very easy to do all of these steps because Tableau can find the field of country and year that is shared by two data sources and do a post-aggregate join on its own.",

    "answer": "Correlation is the statistical measure that shows a relationship between two variables. When one changes, the other changes as well, positively or negatively. However, this doesn't mean that one variable causes the other to change. Causation means that one variable directly causes a change in the other. It implies a cause-and-effect relationship, not just an association. Proving causation requires deeper analysis and additional evidence.Example:There's a correlation between cart abandonment and uninstall rates in a shopping app. Users who abandon their carts often end up uninstalling the app shortly after. But that doesn't mean abandoning a cart causes someone to uninstall the app. The real cause might be a frustrating purchase process with too many steps. That complexity leads to both behaviors: abandoning the cart and uninstalling the app. So, while there's a correlation, you can't say it's causation without looking deeper.",

For example, I might look at the average test score in a class or the frequency of different grade ranges using histograms or summary statistics.Bivariate analysis looks at the relationship between two variables, such as how students' study time affects their test scores. To analyze this, I'd use tools like correlation, scatter plots, or line graphs to identify trends or patterns.Multivariate analysis, on the other hand, deals with three or more variables at once. It focuses on understanding how multiple factors combine to influence an outcome. For example, I might explore how sleep hours, study time, and caffeine intake together impact test scores. In that case, I'd use regression or a tree-based model to analyze the combined effect.",

A wide format has values that do not repeat in the columns, while a long format has values that do repeat in the columns.In wide format, you spread data across columns. Each variable (Jan, Feb, March) gets its own column. You'll usually see this in reports or dashboards.In long format, data is stacked in rows. One column stores the values, and another column tells you what those values represent. This format is cleaner for grouped summaries and time series analysis.Use case:Wide format is useful for reporting and making data visualizations. Long format is preferred for time series, grouped summaries, and plotting tools like Seaborn or ggplot.Common pitfall:Trying to perform group-level analysis on wide-format data without reshaping it first.",

    "question": "What is multicollinearity, and how do you detect it?",
    "answer": "Multicollinearity is when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, meaning they tell similar stories. This makes it hard for the model to figure out which variable is actually influencing the target, leading to unreliable or unstable coefficient estimates.For example, in a regression model looking at economic growth, common variables will be GDP, Unemployment Rate, and Consumer Spending. These variables are all related, and the model might not be as effective as it should be.To detect multicollinearity use:Correlation matrix:A correlation matrix detects multicollinearity by visualizing the strength of relationships between variables. A general rule is that any correlation value above 0.6 indicates strong multicollinearity.Variance inflation factor (VIF):VIF detects multicollinearity by giving a numerical value that indicates how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity. A VIF value greater than 5 indicates ",

In imbalanced datasets, one category has significantly more or fewer samples than the others. Imbalanced data refers to a common issue in supervised machine learning and deep learning where there is a non-uniform distribution of samples among different classes. This can lead to biased outcomes in models, such as those used in healthcare services, impacting their reliability and effectiveness.For example, if you build an email spam detection model and your dataset contains 5% spam emails and 95% non-spam emails, the data is imbalanced toward non-spam. This imbalance can negatively affect the model's performance, especially in production, because it may achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class while failing to detect spam effectively.",
