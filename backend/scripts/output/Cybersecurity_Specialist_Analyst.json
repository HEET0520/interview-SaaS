    "question": "7. How does email work?",
    "answer": "When a sender uses an e-mail program to send an e-mail, it is redirected to a simple e-mail transfer protocol. In this protocol, the recipient's email address belongs to a different domain name or the same domain name as the sender (Gmail, Outlook, etc.). After that, the e-mail will be stored on the server, and later he will send it using thePOPorIMAPprotocol. Then, if the recipient has a different domain name address, theSMTPprotocol communicates with the DNS (Domain Name Server) for the different addresses that the recipient uses. Then the sender's SMTP  communicates with the receiver's SMTP, and the receiver's SMTP performs the communication. This way the email is delivered to the recipient's SMTP. If certain network traffic issues prevent both the sender's SMTP  and the recipient's SMTP from communicating with each other, outgoing emails will be queued at the recipient's SMTP and finally to be received by the recipient. Also, if a message stays in the queue for too long due to terr",
