    "answer": "When a sender uses an e-mail program to send an e-mail, it is redirected to a simple e-mail transfer protocol. In this protocol, the recipient's email address belongs to a different domain name or the same domain name as the sender (Gmail, Outlook, etc.). After that, the e-mail will be stored on the server, and later he will send it using thePOPorIMAPprotocol. Then, if the recipient has a different domain name address, theSMTPprotocol communicates with the DNS (Domain Name Server) for the different addresses that the recipient uses. Then the sender's SMTP  communicates with the receiver's SMTP, and the receiver's SMTP performs the communication. This way the email is delivered to the recipient's SMTP. If certain network traffic issues prevent both the sender's SMTP  and the recipient's SMTP from communicating with each other, outgoing emails will be queued at the recipient's SMTP and finally to be received by the recipient. Also, if a message stays in the queue for too long due to terr",

    "question": "What Is a Brute Force Attack?",
    "answer": "A brute force attack generates multiple strings of alphanumeric characters that can be used aspasswords. These strings then run against the file/service being cracked to find the correct password. Brute force attacks can be used against encrypted files, user account credentials, and even wireless networks with their passwords. There is no particular constraint when it comes to brute force mechanisms. We can generate numbers, alphabets and symbols to guess passwords of any length possible. Granted, the longer and more complicated passwords require much more time and effort to bear fruit.",

    "question": "What is Nikto and it's usages ?",
    "answer": "Nikto is an Open Source software written in Perl language that is used to scan a web-server for the vulnerability that can be exploited and can compromise the server. It can also check for outdated version details of 1200 server and can detect problems with specific version details of over 200 servers. It can also fingerprint server using favicon.ico files present in the server. It is not designed to be a particularly a stealth tool rather than it is designed to be fast and time-efficient to achieve the task in very little time. Because of this, a web admin can easily detect that its server is being scanned by looking into the log files. It can also show some items that do not have security problem but are info only which shows how to take full use of it to secure the web-server more properly. Features:",

    "answer": "A banner may be a text displayed by a number server containing details like software type and version running during a system or server. Banner grabbing involves getting software banner information, like the name and version of the running server or system. Hackers can perform banner grabbing manually or automatically using an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence Tool). Grabbing a banner is one of the primary phases in both offensive and defensive penetration testing circumstances.",
