    "answer": "A container is a runtime instance of a container image (which is a lightweight, executable package that includes everything needed to run your code). It is the execution environment that runs the application or service defined by the container image.When a container is started, it becomes an isolated process on the host machine with its own filesystem, network interfaces, and other resources. Containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them more efficient and quicker to start than virtual machines.A virtual machine (VM), on the other hand, is an emulation of a physical computer. Each VM runs a full operating system and has virtualized hardware, which makes them more resource-intensive and slower to start compared to containers.",

    "answer": "Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later or multiple developers can work on the same codebase and eventually merge their work streams together with minimum effort.It is important in DevOps because it allows multiple team members to collaborate on code, tracks and manages changes efficiently, enables rollback to previous versions if issues arise, and supports automation in CI/CD pipelines, ensuring consistent and reliable software delivery (which is one of the key principles of DevOps).In terms of tooling, one of the best and most popular version control systems is Git. It provides what is known as a distributed version control system, giving every team member a piece of the code so they can branch it, work on it however they feel like it, and push it back to the rest of the team once they’re done.That said, there are other legacy teams using alternatives like CVS or SVN.",

    "question": "How would you handle file uploads in a web application?",
    "answer": "From a backend developer perspective, the following considerations should be taken into account when handling file uploads regardless of the programming language you’re using:Perform server-side validations.Validate that the size of your file is within range, and that the file is of the required type. You can checkthis OWASP guidefor more details.Use secure channels.Make sure the file upload is done through an HTTPS connection.Avoid name collision.Rename the file ensuring the new filename is unique within your system. Otherwise this can lead to application errors by not being able to save the uploaded files.Keep metadata about your files.Store it in your database or somewhere else, but make sure to keep track of it, so you can provide extra information to your users. Also, if you’re renaming the files for security and to avoid name collisions, keep track of the original filename in case the file needs to be downloaded back by the user.",

    "question": "What kind of tests would you write for a new API endpoint?",
    "answer": "As backend developers, we have to think about the types of tests that there are out there.Unit tests:Always remember to only test the relevant logic through the public interface of your code (avoid testing private methods or inaccessible functions inside your modules). Focus on the business logic and don’t try to test the code that uses external services (like a database, the disk or anything outside of the piece of code you’re testing).Integration tests:Test the full endpoint through its public interface (the actual HTTP endpoint) and see how it integrates with the external services it’s using (i.e the database, another API, etc).Load testing / performance testing:You might want to also check how the new endpoint behaves under heavy stress. This might not be required depending on the API you’re using, but as a rule of thumb, it’s a good one to perform at the end of the development phase before releasing the new endpoint into prod.",

Keeping a list of blacklisted characters to escape in this situation is a good idea, so you can programmatically go through them.",

After that, the e-mail will be stored on the server, and later he will send it using thePOPorIMAPprotocol. Then, if the recipient has a different domain name address, theSMTPprotocol communicates with the DNS (Domain Name Server) for the different addresses that the recipient uses. Then the sender's SMTP  communicates with the receiver's SMTP, and the receiver's SMTP performs the communication. This way the email is delivered to the recipient's SMTP. If certain network traffic issues prevent both the sender's SMTP  and the recipient's SMTP from communicating with each other, outgoing emails will be queued at the recipient's SMTP and finally to be received by the recipient.

    "question": "What is chaos engineering?",
    "answer": "Chaos engineeringis a discipline where it is intentional to cause interruptions in the system to personify the weaknesses and vulnerabilities within the system. The aim is to ensure the stability of the software system by recreating various types of faults (for example, server crashes, network outages, etc.) in a controlled environment to see what kind of reaction a system produces under stress. Through this process, engineers can identify and correct flaws, avoid causing major failures, and stop disruptions that may lead to production losses.",

    "answer": "Chaos Monkey is a tool within the Simian Army suite, developed by Netflix. It randomly terminates instances within the system's infrastructure to test the application's resilience to sudden failures. Chaos Monkey works as an engineer’s tool to simulate the loss of services or infrastructure components and guarantees that the system can perform effectively even in the event of the loss of the component. This is achieved by having the program run in the background, where it will occasionally shut down instances as a form of constant exercising and strengthening of the system.",
